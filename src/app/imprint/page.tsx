          <strong>
            Relevant legal bases according to the General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR):
          </strong>{" "}
          Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on
          which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
          provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply
          in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, if more
          specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform
          you of these in the data privacy policy.

              6(1)(b) GDPR)
            </strong>{" "}
            - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
            the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request
            of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> -
            Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
            interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
            freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal
            data.

        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In
          addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data
          protection regulations may apply in Germany. This includes in
          particular the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz –
          BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special provisions on the right
          to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of
          special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes,
          and the transfer as well as automated decision-making in individual
          cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it may be possible for the
          data protection laws of the individual states to apply.

        <p>
          <strong>Reference to the GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act:</strong>{" "}
          These data protection notices serve to provide information in
          accordance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Schweizer DSG)
          as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore,
          please note that due to the broader spatial application and
          understandability, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, the
          terms “processing” of “personal data,” “legitimate interest,” and
          “special categories of data” are used instead of the terms used in the
          Swiss DSG, “processing” of “personal data,” “overriding interest,” and
          “particularly sensitive personal data.” However, the legal meaning of
          these terms continues to be determined in accordance with the Swiss
          DSG as part of the application of the Swiss DSG.

          Security Measures
        </h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in
          accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of
          the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and
          purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and
          severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures include ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and
          availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to
          the data as well as controlling access, input, disclosure,
          availability, and separation of data. Furthermore, we have established
          procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects&apos; rights, the
          deletion of data, and responses to the protection of data.
          Furthermore, we take data protection into account when developing or
          selecting hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the
          principle of data protection by design and data protection-friendly
          default settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          TLS/SSL encryption (https): To protect user data transmitted via our
          online services, we use TLS/SSL encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
          is the standard technology for securing internet connections by
          encrypting data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or
          between two servers). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an updated and
          more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure
          (HTTPS) is displayed in the URL when a website is secured by an
          SSL/TLS certificate.

          Transmission of Personal Data
        </h2>
        <p>
          As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the
          data is transferred to other entities, companies, legally independent
          organizational units, or individuals or disclosed to them. These
          recipients of the data may include service providers or providers of
          services and content, such as those integrated into a website, with IT
          tasks. In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and, in
          particular, conclude the necessary contracts or agreements with the
          recipients of your data to protect your data.

          International Data Transfers
        </h2>
        <p>
          Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third
          country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European
          Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing takes place as part of the use
          of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other
          persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance
          with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third
          country has been recognized by a decision of adequacy (Art. 45 GDPR),
          this decision serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise,
          data transfers will only take place if the level of data protection is
          otherwise secured, in particular by means of standard contractual
          clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent or if the transfer is
          necessary for the performance of a contract or the implementation of
          pre-contractual measures (Art. 49(1) GDPR). Furthermore, we will
          inform you about the legal basis for the transfer to third countries
          by the individual providers from third countries, whereby decisions of
          adequacy are given priority as a basis. Information on third-country
          transfers and the existence of adequacy decisions can be found in the
          information provided by the European Commission:{" "}

          has also recognized the level of data protection as safe for certain
          companies from the USA in accordance with the adequacy decision of

          Web Analysis, Monitoring, and Optimization
        </h2>
        <p>
          Web analysis (also known as &quot;reach measurement&quot;) is used to
          evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offering and may include
          pseudonymous values that reflect the behavior, interests, or
          demographic information of visitors, such as age or gender. With the
          help of reach analysis, we can, for example, determine at what time
          our online offering or its functions or content is most frequently
          visited or invite reuse. We can also understand which areas require
          optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to web analysis, we may also use test procedures to test
          and optimize different versions of our online offering or its
          components, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e., data summarized for a
          user using a pseudonym, are created and information is stored in a
          browser or device and read from it for these purposes. The information
          collected may include, in particular, websites visited and elements
          used there, as well as technical information such as the browser used,
          the computer system used, and information on usage times. If users
          have given their consent to us or to the providers we use to collect
          their location data, location data may also be processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking
          method (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to
          protect users. In principle, we and the providers of the software we
          use do not store clear data of the users (such as email addresses or
          names) during web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but only
          pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers do not know the
          actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their
          profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.
